![I'm the alt text for an image](https://prod.static9.net.au/_/media/Network/Images/2018/01/18/12/50/doctorconsultimage.jpg)

This project analyses information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

>Some findings got from this analysis includes:

* Patients who visit the hospital are mostly around 37 years of age.
*  65% of the patients are female, while 35% are male.
* Some neighbourhood had the highest number of patients that showed while some neighbourhood didn't show up. This might be as a result of the distance between these neighbourhood and the hospital.
* Schedule made between 4 to 15 days seem to show up more for appointments. This might be as a result of them being able to remember. I suggest that sms should be sent to the patients who made schedule that are more that 2 weeks.
* The patients that had hypertension are 3.6% greater than those without the disease that showed up.
* The patients that are handicapped are 2.14% greater than those that are not handicapped that showed up.
*  The patients that had diabetes are 2.36% greater than those without the disease that showed up.
Alcoholism does not affect the show up of patients for their appointments
* Scholarship and sms received does not affect the attendance of patients for their appointment.

I believe this is a great spot for relaxation.
Do have a wonderful exploration.
